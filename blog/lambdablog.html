        <h2>Lambda use with the Standard Template Library</h2>
        <p>Lambda expressions were added in C++11 and allow you to create temporary, unnamed functions. Though unnamed, these can be assigned to variables as they are
        considered rvalues. Lambda's can also be immediately invoked with the () operator which allows the programmer the ability to do complex initialization on a const variable.
        It is important to note that much of what you can do with Lambdas can be done with standard functions however Lambda's are often used to increase readability and locality
        of the code.</p>
        <p>Lambda's can be passed to functions through function pointer parameters, something that many functions from the Standard Template Library utilise. For example, the
        std::sort function from the algorithm header. Since the function may not know how to sort through a custom object a lambda may be used to essentially "show the function"
        how to sort it. More specifically it shows how to compare the values. Here is an example from a neural network library I created:</p>
        <div class="codebox">
            <code>
                std::sort(generation.begin(), generation.end(), [](const network& a, const network& b){
                <p></p>
                return a.fitness > b.fitness;
                <p></p>
                });
            </code>
        </div>
        <p>Here the lambda is telling the sort function to compare the networks using their fitness values using the greater than operator. It is important to note here that
        if the less than operator was used here then it would sort the networks in ascended order rather than descending.</p>
